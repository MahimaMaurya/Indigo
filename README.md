# Indigo Case Study

# Summary
This project aims to develop a robust question-answering (QA) model using the Quora Question Answer dataset, focusing on creating a system that mimics human-like interaction. The report details the development and evaluation process, including data preprocessing techniques. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reveals insights into question and answer columns. The study compares the performance of three transformer-based models—BERT, T5, and GPT—highlighting their architecture, training process, and performance metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, and F1-score). The evaluation shows that while all models generate relevant responses, the GPT model performs best.
